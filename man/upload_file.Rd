\title{Upload content to the HPC resource}
\usage{
upload_file(config, content, filename, use_chunked_threshold_mb = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{config}{API configuration created by create_api_config}

\item{content}{Content to upload (raw vector, character, file path, or other object)}

\item{filename}{Name to use for the uploaded content}

\item{use_chunked_threshold_mb}{Threshold in MB for using chunked upload (default: 100)}
}
\value{
TRUE if the content was successfully uploaded or already exists
}
\description{
Upload content to the HPC resource
}
\details{
This function automatically detects if content is a file path and uses chunked
upload for files larger than the threshold. For in-memory objects, it uses the
standard upload method. Chunked upload is more memory-efficient for large files.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
config <- create_api_config("http://localhost", 9000, "please_change_me")

# Upload in-memory content
content <- "Hello, World!"
upload_file(config, content, "hello.txt")

# Upload file (automatically uses chunked upload if > 100 MB)
upload_file(config, "large_dataset.rds", "dataset.rds")

# Customize chunked threshold
upload_file(config, "medium_file.csv", "data.csv", use_chunked_threshold_mb = 50)
}
}
