\title{Upload an R object using chunked upload}
\usage{
upload_object(config, obj, filename, chunk_size_mb = 10, show_progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{config}{API configuration created by create_api_config}

\item{obj}{R object to upload (will be serialized)}

\item{filename}{Name to use for the uploaded content}

\item{chunk_size_mb}{Size of each chunk in megabytes (default: 10)}

\item{show_progress}{Show progress bar (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
TRUE if the upload was successful
}
\description{
Upload an R object using chunked upload
}
\details{
This function uploads R objects using chunked upload without creating temporary files.
The object is serialized to raw bytes in memory, then uploaded in chunks.
Memory is freed progressively as chunks are uploaded.

Process:
\enumerate{
\item Serialize object to raw vector
\item Calculate hash of serialized bytes
\item Check if already exists (deduplication)
\item Upload in chunks, freeing memory after each chunk
\item Show progress bar
}

Peak memory usage: object size + ~1.5x chunk_size

\dontrun{
config <- create_api_config("http://localhost", 8001, "key",
                            auth_header = "X-API-Key", auth_prefix = "")

# Upload large data frame
big_df <- data.frame(x = 1:1000000, y = rnorm(1000000))
upload_object(config, big_df, "big_data.rds")

# Upload list
my_list <- list(a = 1:100, b = letters, c = iris)
upload_object(config, my_list, "my_list.rds", chunk_size_mb = 5)
}
}
