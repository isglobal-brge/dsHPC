Description: Provides a comprehensive R client for interacting with DataSHIELD's 
    High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems through REST APIs. Features include 
    content-based caching with SHA-256 hashing for automatic deduplication, 
    deterministic file compression for consistent hash generation, memory-efficient 
    chunked file uploads with progress tracking, job submission and monitoring 
    (both individual jobs and multi-step processing chains), and flexible APIs for 
    custom upload workflows. The package integrates with the 'resourcer' framework 
    for DataSHIELD compatibility and offers imperative, functional, and helper APIs 
    for efficient workflow management in DataSHIELD environments.
