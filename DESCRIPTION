Description: Provides a comprehensive R client for interacting with DataSHIELD's 
    High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems through REST APIs. Features include 
    content-based caching with SHA-256 hashing for automatic deduplication, 
    deterministic file compression for consistent hash generation, job submission 
    and monitoring (both individual jobs and multi-step processing chains), and 
    optimized file upload with base64 encoding. The package integrates with the 
    'resourcer' framework for DataSHIELD compatibility and offers both simple and 
    hash-based APIs for efficient workflow management in DataSHIELD environments.
